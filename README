Introduction:

Android development is moving towards the Gradle build system, and away from the
previously used Ant system; this has lead to a change build tree structure, which
the previous Emacs Android modes cannot support - this mode is a basic attempt to
create a set of Emacs functions to create, build and install basic Android projects
with Emacs

Useage:

and-gradle-build-dir - This will create and populate the directory tree, as requried 
		       by Gradle, it will request a project name and package-name 
		       ("com.Example") unless and-gradle-project-package-name has been
		       set

and-gradle-build-project - This funcion will ask for the root directory of the project
			   to be compiled; it will then use the Emacs compilation mode
			   to ensure error highlighting is available; this will only
			   build the apk files

and-gradle-build-and-install-project - This will build, as mentioned previously, then
				       use adb (ensure this is in path) to install
				       and run the project

TODO:

Lots of work to do:
     *	Allow for custom path to Android SDK tools
     *	Test on a windows enviroment
     *	Error handling
